**Simple Linear Regression

Draws a straight line representing the training set(univariate) according to which predictions can be made.

Instructions:
	If the dataset is to be imported, uncomment **import pandas as pd** & **data = pd.read_csv('filename.type')** at top

and  **x = data[data.columns[0:1]]** & **y = data[data.columns[-1]]** located in the driver section of the code.

Ensure that the filetype imported is supported by the pandas package.

**KNN

Classification algorithm that perdicts the species of a flower based on multiple inputs


**The program requires the following packages: 

	numpy
	
	sklearn

	matplotlib
